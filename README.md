## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi there!

I'm Lawrence, a Data Professional with a strong focus in SQL, Python, Tableau and Power BI. I share all my portfolio projects here on Github, and where necessary I also provide project documentation to improve stakeholder understanding.

With expertise in query optimization, database design, data modelling, data analysis and data visualization, I'm passionate about helping businesses make sense of their data.

Currently, I'm open to remote and on-site opportunities in roles such as SQL Developer, Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst.
